# Retail

This is a small project developed, within an 8-hour time limit, for a retail company to demonstrate my iOS development ability. Please find the requirements below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Requirements:

1. Implement a product list page with JSON fetched from the following URL: "https://run.mocky.io/v3/5c138271-d8dd-4112-8fb4-3adb1b7f689e". Tapping on the wishlist icon at item level should add/remove the item to a locally maintained wishlist.

2. Tapping on the wishlist button on the top right should present a wish list screen and display the items that are present in the wishlist. The remove button should remove the item from the wishlist, and the close button should dismiss the view.

3. Tapping on any product should open a product detail page as given below.
  a. The wishlist button should act as it does in the product list page.
  b. The add-to-bag button should add the item to a local cart-item list, and items that are in the cart already should show the add-to-bag button as disabled.
